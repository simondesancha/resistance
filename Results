When doing the GA based on the maximum suspicion values, very quickly converged to:
	 {0.43, 0.27, 0.99, 0.49, 0.51, 0.09, 0.08};
but was not good when actually versing the bots (%63 failure)

-- above is without genetic diversity

with 2% mutation:

	0.06, 0.15, 0.99, 0.93, 0.97, 0.18, 0.50

but still useless




changing to same bot is duplicated 3 times, plays expert spy 10 times and pick max outcome:
	0.15, 0.77, 0.97, 0.79, 0.53, 0.14, 0.27

still pretty bad ~55% fail


Note; the above was with the spies always at 1st and 2nd.
	this gave them a big advantage - hence always winning.


now with randomly allocated, still versuing self:
	Pop=100
	muation = 0.05
	by #64 gen we get ~%98 success rate
	
	0.49, 0.09, 0.80, 0.99, 0.42, 0.23, 0.08


Running selecting the highest suspicion for spies/lowest for resistance doesn't work well.

Selecting all winning teams doesn't work well either, doesn't converge,
but works when averaging over a time, not as well as above.
	-doesn't converge fast
